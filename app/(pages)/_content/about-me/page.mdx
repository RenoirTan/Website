# About Me

Hello, my name is Renoir.

I'm a programmer who has had at least 6 years of programming by this point. My main languages are Python, Rust, C and recently JavaScript and TypeScript. I have also dabbled in competitions in fields like Cybersecurity and AI, as well as contributed to a few coding events in Singapore.
