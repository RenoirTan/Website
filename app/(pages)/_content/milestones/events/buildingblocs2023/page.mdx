# BuildingBlocs 2023

I served as BuildingBloCS' lead for the publicity and design team. BuildingBloCS is a student-run programme that teaches programming and artificial skills to secondary school students, from beginner to advanced levels depending on their prior ability. The 2023 programme comprises multiple conferences where speakers from BuildingBloCS conduct workshops for students, of which I was involved in the March and June conferences. As lead for publicity and design, I led my team to design promotional material for social media and merchandise. Although design was not my forte, I was willing to get out of my comfort zone and try something new.
