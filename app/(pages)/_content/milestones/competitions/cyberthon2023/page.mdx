# Cyberthon

My group *Nijika Fan Club* (not my choice) won 9th place out of 87 teams in Cyberthon 2023, a Capture the Flag cybersecurity competition organised by Hwa Chong Institution, Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies and Defence Cyber Organisation.

I helped my team to complete the "Pwn" category of challenges, which involves identifying vulnerabilities in binary executables and exploiting them to obtain a flag which can be exchanged for points.

This competition required me to learn how assembly language, x86, computer memory and classes of vulnerabilities work, applying knowledge I acquired during the time at my school's Computer Science Society and Cyberthon's training before the competition day.
