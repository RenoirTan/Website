# CSSxCDAC

I was the lead for Raffles Institution's "Learn to Code!" Team 1. "Learn to Code!" was a community service project by RI's Computer Science Society held at the Chinese Development Assistance Council that aimed to teach novice secondary school students basic Python by guiding them through a Discord bot.

As the team lead, I was responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the lesson, creation of the template Discord bot and production of lesson materials, as well as conducting some parts of the lesson myself. This experience allowed me to collaborate with my friends and my CCA mates to deliver something fruitful to budding coders, taking into account everyone's suggestions and building on top of them in order to create a half-day lesson with a pace suitable to beginner programmers. In addition, by trying my hand at teaching the secondary school students, I had to communicate clearly and simply to introduce basic programming concepts and algorithms.

The final product each student had to complete was a discord bot. Let's see some of them in action!
