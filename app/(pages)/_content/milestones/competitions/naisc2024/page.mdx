# National AI Student Challenge 2024 (Track 1)

The {<TextLink.Main href="https://learn.aisingapore.org/naisc2024/">National AI Student Challenge</TextLink.Main>} is a competition for students to showcase their skills in AI. For 2024, there are 3 tracks. Track 1, by the *AI Professionals Association* requires participants to create a model to predict the adoption of rates of pets listed on {<TextLink.Main href="https://petfinder.my">PetFinder.my</TextLink.Main>}, while the other 2 tracks involves developing or tuning an existing large-language model. Due to the eligibility criteria (NSF), I was only able to join the competition under track 1.

Before I could create my model, I had to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis {<TextLink.Main href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis">(EDA)</TextLink.Main>} and present the data to the judges. There were roughly 15 thousand pets (or data points, in this case), but after removing duplicates and cleaning up the data, this number came to 14,858 rows. In addition, I inferred additional data using the descriptions that came with each pet listing. For example, with {<TextLink.Main href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">TextBlob</TextLink.Main>}, I could run sentiment analysis on the description submitted for each pet, and with {<TextLink.Main href="https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</TextLink.Main>} I could detect the language for used for the description. Using the clean data, I used {<TextLink.Main href="https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/">ydata-profiling</TextLink.Main>} to generate a simple report for me to visualise correlations between different variables (such as between age of the pet and likelihood of being adopted). However, most of the analysis is contained in the notebook `eda.ipynb` where I used {<TextLink.Main href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</TextLink.Main>} and {<TextLink.Main href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</TextLink.Main>} to produce graphs and to ultimate draw the judges to important correlations between certain variables and the time it took for a pet to go from being listed to being adopted. These variables include but are not limited to age, health and number of photos in the listing. For instance, visitors of PetFinder.my are more likely to adopt younger animals. Unfortunately, the correlation between most of the variables and adoption outcome/speed is quite low (e.g. the {<TextLink.Main href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r's_V">Cramér's V</TextLink.Main>} value φc between age and adoption speed = 0.125 w/ 4 degrees of freedom). This would have negative implications for model training as they cannot reliably use patterns in the data to predict adoption speed.

With a clearer picture of the data, I proceeded to create my prediction models. I opted to make models using both {<TextLink.Main href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">scikit-learn</TextLink.Main>} and {<TextLink.Main href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow</TextLink.Main>} as I wanted to try both (to be fair, I had loads of time after A-levels). In the end, I had 6 models. For each of scikit-learn and tensorflow, I created the following 3 models, a binary classifier (adopted or not), a speed classifier (how fast a pet was adopted) and a regressor (how fast a pet was adopted, but as a scale). As expected from my EDA, the model accuracy was not that high. For the binary classifiers, the best result I got (using the `RandomForestClassifier`) was **76.6%** accuracy but with a specificity of **31.9%**, indicating a high rate of false positives (predicted adopted when not actually the case). For the speed classifier, I got a maximum of **41.3%**, indicating the model only predicted the correct duration between listing and adoption 2-fifths of the time. It wasn't a prettier picture for the speed regressors, the best result had a mean square error of **1.1368**, so a pet that was predicted to be adopted between 31 and 90 days has a **~19%** to not be adopted at all.

Although I had my models, this was not the end of the project. Looking at the challenge again, there is clearly a high emphasis on the ethics on data collection and use of the models.

> Please note that the development and use of such a prediction model might involve several
ethical and safety concerns that may need to be carefully considered so that the system may
be trusted.

Hence, I placed a greater emphasis on the ethics of my models. Given the low accuracy of my models, they could not be used to replace other methods of predicting adoption outcomes, but to supplement them. In addition, while my models could be used to rank pets based on how likely they are to be adopted, they could severely disadvantage older pets who are just as deserving of a home, so my models could be used to highlight such disadvantaged pets that my models predict would not be adopted, and recommend them to the user.

While I was very happy with the outcome of the competition, I felt that there could be some improvements to my project. For example, when trying to infer data from the description of each pet listing, I could employ the use of LLMs to pull keywords, the presence or absence of which can be used to train the model. I could even find the actual listing for each pet on PetFinder.my and pull the images and videos included in the listing and train a deep learning model on them to predict adoption outcomes. Moreover, we only got data about the pets. If we had information on the users, we can get an idea of what kind of users are more likely to adopt what kind of pets, making recommendations more personal.
