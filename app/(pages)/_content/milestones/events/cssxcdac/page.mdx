# CSSxCDAC

"Learn to Code!" is a community service project by RI's Computer Science Society held at the Chinese Development Assistance Council. It aims to teach novice secondary school students basic Python by guiding them through coding a Telegram or Discord bot. The project was split into 2 groups, one creating a Telegram bot and the other creating a Discord bot. As team leader for the latter group, I was responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the lesson, creation of the template Discord bot and production of lesson materials, as well as conducting some parts of the lesson myself.
