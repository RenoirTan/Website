# About Me

Hello, my name is Renoir.

I'm a programmer who has had at least 6 years of programming by this point. My main languages are Python, Rust, C and recently JavaScript and TypeScript. I have also dabbled in competitions in fields like Cybersecurity and AI, as well as contributed to a few coding events in Singapore.

## Competitions

{getCompetitionsPath().map(async (path) => {
    // path is relative to ./app/(pages)/_content/competitions/index.ts
    const competitionMetadata = await getCompetitionMetadata(`./${path}/page.mdx`);
    const key = path;
    const href = `/competitions/${path}`;

    return <CompetitionCard key={key} href={href} {...competitionMetadata} />;
})}
